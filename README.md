# SMART-ALARM-CLOCK
Language:Vertilog     Board:DE10-Lite         Description: For the project, I decided to replicate the elements of a smartwatch app found on most phones. I implemented the project on the DE-10 LITE board using the Vertilog. The features that were included were a standard 24-hour clock that will display the correct time inputted by the user; an alarm set by the user that will result in audio and visual cues to be triggered till the reset key is pressed or a minute has passed; a timer count down set by the user that will enable audio and visual cues till the user resets the timer; and a stopwatch indicating the time that has passed for when the user has enabled or disabled the clock itself. All of the time values are to be displayed on the board's HEX display in the following format: Hours:Minutes:Seconds.
